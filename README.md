### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
  I don't think I learned anything this time because this project was almost the same as previous projects.

### Continued development
  I need to focus on using rem for responsiveness. On the one hand, it seems like a great tool but on the other, it might interrupt with flexbox. So, you need to balance powers of flexbox and rem.
